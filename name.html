                <h2>Hydroelectric Energy</h2>
                <p>Hydroelectric power uses flowing water, typically from dams or natural waterfalls, to generate electricity. It's one of the most established forms of renewable energy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="energy-type" id="geothermal">
                <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.Ph39j2EbXLvZDx-u0SRFZwHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain">
                <h2>Geothermal Energy</h2>
                <p>Geothermal energy taps into the heat beneath the Earth's surface, using steam or hot water to generate electricity or for direct heating purposes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="energy-type" id="biomass">
                <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.WBo4HpeBqEfxYOFB1MIwNQHaFR?w=260&h=185&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=1.3&pid=1.7">
                <h2>Biomass Energy</h2>
                <p>Biomass energy comes from organic materials like plants, wood, and agricultural waste. These materials can be burned for heat or converted into biofuels.</p>

            <h1>Benefits of Renewable Energy</h1>
            <div class="benefit" >
                <h2>Environmental Benefits</h2>
                <p>Renewable energy significantly reduces carbon emissions, helping to mitigate climate change. It also minimizes air and water pollution compared to fossil fuels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit">
                <h2>Economic Benefits</h2>
                <p>Investing in renewable energy creates jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance. It also promotes energy independence, reducing reliance on imported fuels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit">
                <h2>Social Benefits</h2>
                <p>Renewable energy provides access to affordable electricity in remote or underserved areas. It fosters community development and enhances quality of life through sustainable power solutions.</p>
            </div>

        <section id="challenges">
            <h1>Challenges to Renewable Energy Adoption</h1>
            <div class="challenge">
                <h2>High Initial Costs</h2>
                <p>While renewable energy technologies have become more affordable, the initial costs for installation and infrastructure can still be high, making it difficult for some regions or individuals to adopt these solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge">
                <h2>Intermittency Issues</h2>
                <p>Some renewable energy sources like solar and wind are intermittent, meaning they aren't always available. Solutions like battery storage and hybrid systems are emerging to address this challenge.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge">
                <h2>Land Use and Space Requirements</h2>
                <p>Renewable energy projects, particularly solar farms and wind turbines, require significant land area, which can be challenging in densely populated areas.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge">
                <h2>Grid Integration</h2>
                <p>Integrating renewable energy into existing electrical grids can be complex and costly, as grid infrastructure needs to be upgraded to handle distributed and fluctuating energy sources.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="challenge">
                <h2>Policy and Regulatory Barriers</h2>
                <p>Governments must adopt policies that incentivize renewable energy adoption. Regulatory hurdles and lack of supportive policies can hinder progress in some regions.</p>
